## How Skills Work

Skills use progressive disclosure:

1. **Tier 1** (always loaded): name + description (~50 tokens) — matches your requests
2. **Tier 2** (on activation): SKILL.md body — the actual instructions
3. **Tier 3** (on demand): reference files for detailed material

When you ask your AI assistant to do something that matches a skill's description, it loads automatically. Skills that involve writing include defaults that work standalone — if you have personal preferences in your CLAUDE.md, those override the defaults.
