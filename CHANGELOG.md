## [2.5.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **`synthesis-meeting-transcripts`** (v0.1.0) — new skill for fetching AI-generated meeting transcripts (Gemini notes + full word-for-word dialogue) from Gmail/Drive into local markdown archives. Tool-agnostic core — works with Anthropic's hosted Gmail/Drive connectors (single account) or self-hosted multi-account MCPs. Per-project config via `.claude/meeting-transcripts.yaml` with named meeting patterns plus a generic fallback. Includes an `optional-workspace-mcp/` bundle with cross-platform auto-start (macOS launchd + Linux systemd user units), start/stop helpers, and a deterministic Python fetcher for shell/cron use. Replaces the manual Gmail → Google Doc → export-markdown → Downloads workflow.

### Changed
- **`synthesis-daily-rituals`** bumped to v2.2.0 — Step 2b "Meeting Transcripts" now documents an automated path via `synthesis-meeting-transcripts` as the preferred option, with the manual Downloads-folder path retained as a fallback for users without Gmail/Drive tooling.

### Rationale
Google Meet + Gemini produces excellent meeting notes + full transcripts, but accessing them requires a tedious manual flow: open Gmail, find the notes email, open the linked Doc, export as markdown with both tabs checked, move the file out of Downloads, archive the email. This new skill collapses that into a single invocation and integrates with the daily ritual so transcripts land in the project archive automatically. The tool-agnostic design keeps the common single-account path simple while making multi-account setups feasible for users with work spanning several Google Workspaces.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-04-20

### Changed
- **`synthesis-code-integration`** bumped to v1.3.1 — the new "Branch Hygiene" section is now branch-name-agnostic. Previous wording hardcoded `main`/`develop`, which tied the rule to Gitflow-style teams and excluded GitHub Flow, trunk-based, environment-branch, and other workflows. The rule is now framed around generic terms ("PR target branch" and "staging branch"), with a Gitflow example kept as one concrete illustration rather than the default.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-20

### Changed
- **`synthesis-code-integration`** bumped to v1.3.0 — added mandatory "Branch Hygiene: PR Branches Stay Clean of Staging Content" section with the anti-pattern explanation, the correct per-operation sequence for getting a commit on both PR branch and staging, rationale for why a polluted PR diff is harmful (reviewer time, scope concerns, squash-merge risk), and the incident that motivated the rule.

### Rationale
A one-commit chore PR was opened against `main`. To fast-forward a push to `develop` for staging, the agent merged `develop` into the PR branch. The PR diff ballooned to 6,900 changes from unreleased staging work. The team opened "request changes" on scope grounds. The correct pattern — push to develop as a separate operation, keep PR branch clean — is now codified in the skill.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-04-16

### Changed
- **`synthesis-context-lifecycle`** bumped to v1.1.0 — replaced "Session-End Commit Requirement" with a "Commit Protocol" section that is not deferred to day-end. Added explicit scope rule: only commit repos touched in the current invocation, never workspace-wide. Added reasoning for why point-of-modification commits beat session-end commits (session never ends cleanly, modified rituals skip day-end, compounding uncommitted work).
- **`synthesis-daily-rituals`** bumped to v2.1.0 — added full **Vacation / Observer Mode Ritual** section codifying the sync+context+commit pattern for users who are not actively working. Added top-level **Commit Protocol** section with the same scope rule. Added explicit commit-after-sync requirement to Mid-Day Sync Protocol. Documents what observer mode skips deliberately (messages, comms, amplification) vs. what it must keep (sync, transcripts, commits).
- **`synthesis-repo-guard`** bumped to v1.1.0 — clarified that the skill is a detector, not a committer. Added "Detection vs. Commit" distinction explaining why detection is workspace-wide but commits must be per-invocation-scoped. Updated Claude Code hook recommendation: removed `--quiet` default (silent hooks teach nothing), added `--dirty-only` for scannable output. Added "Defense in Depth" section recommending both `Stop` and `SessionEnd` hooks for long-running conversation scenarios.

### Rationale
Context changes were going uncommitted during long-running and resumed sessions because the commit step was buried in day-end checklists that partial/modified rituals skipped. This release makes commit-and-push part of the same action as context modification, scoped to the current invocation's actual changes.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **`synthesis-code-audit`** v1.0.0 — 10-dimension diff-based quality framework with PASS/WARNING/FAIL scoring, PR review mode cross-referencing, and context isolation principle
- **`synthesis-preflight`** v1.0.0 — pre-merge quality gate framework with 6 orthogonal dimensions, temporary considerations pattern for tracking workarounds, and mechanical go/no-go verdict
- **`synthesis-review-triage`** v1.0.0 — PR prioritization methodology with weighted scoring (review gap, CI, age, size, labels), author-response detection, queue classification, and prior-review gate

### Changed
- **`synthesis-pr-review`** — expanded "Where This Fits" table from 4 to 8 engineering skills covering the full development lifecycle; added code-audit cross-reference section
- **`synthesis-implementation-integrity`** — expanded "Where This Fits" table to include code-audit and preflight in the verification chain
- **`synthesis-codebase-review`** — expanded "Relationship to Other Verification Skills" to include code-audit and preflight
- **README** — added 3 new skills to Engineering table, updated skill count to 29

### Fixed
- **install.sh** — added 7 missing skills to uninstall fallback list (4 pre-existing: implementation-integrity, skills-manager, slack-sync, voice-profiler + 3 new: code-audit, preflight, review-triage)

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **`synthesis-thinking-framework`** — new skill: four-mode thinking methodology (first principles → systems → complexity → design) with pre-response protocol
- **`synthesis-mac-sync`** — new skill: multi-Mac configuration sync via iCloud with git repo sync, machine inventory, and one-time action system

### Changed
- **`synthesis-pr-review`** bumped to v1.1.0 — 6 improvements from CSA review sprint:
  - Project-specific extension points (convention debt patterns, CLAUDE.md hooks)
  - Scope governance check (PR title vs. actual file scope)
  - Bundled test file detection
  - Structured review comment format with severity labels ([M1], [S1], [C1], [N1])
  - AI-assisted review verification step
  - Post-merge verification reference (generic extension point)
- **README** — added "Learn More" link to launch blog post, updated skill count to 22

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-18

### Changed (BREAKING)
- **All skills renamed with `synthesis-` prefix** for namespace protection
- **3 content skills merged into 1:** `blog-promotion` + `social-media-post` + `content-promotion` → `synthesis-content-distribution`
- **Skills renamed for clarity** (not just prefixed):
  - `multi-contributor-synthesis-coding` → `synthesis-code-integration`
  - `code-generation` → `synthesis-code-planning`
  - `thought-leadership-writing` → `synthesis-article-writing`
  - `hyperlink-research` → `synthesis-link-research`
  - `ai-content-quality` → `synthesis-content-quality`
  - `blog-revitalization` → `synthesis-blog-refresh`
  - `message-condensation` → `synthesis-concise-messaging`
  - `llm-project-setup` → `synthesis-llm-setup`
  - `creative-writer-setup` → `synthesis-creative-writer`
  - `technical-advisor-setup` → `synthesis-technical-advisor`
  - `anti-watermarking` → `synthesis-clean-text`
  - `response-synthesis` → `synthesis-response-merger`

### Migration from v1.x
```bash
./install.sh uninstall && ./install.sh install
```

### Why breaking
Generic skill names (`pr-review`, `fact-checking`) collide with other skill repos. The `synthesis-` prefix makes every skill globally unique and immediately identifiable as part of this collection.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-18

Initial release: 22 public Agent Skills. Superseded by v2.0.0 on the same day.

### Installation

```bash
npx skills add synthesisengineering/synthesis-skills --global --all --copy
```
