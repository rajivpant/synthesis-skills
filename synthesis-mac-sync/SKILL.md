# Synthesis Mac Sync

A methodology for keeping multiple Macs in sync using iCloud for configuration files and Git for repositories. Designed to run fully automated via an AI coding assistant — the user says "run my mac-sync" and the assistant handles everything.

This skill provides the **protocol** — the sync methodology, safety rules, conflict resolution, and manifest format. Your personal **config file** (a README or manifest in your iCloud sync folder) provides the specifics: which files, which machines, which repos.

## Configuration

These values are user-specific. Update them for your environment.

| Setting | Value | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `icloud_sync_folder` | `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/workspaces/[username]/mac-sync/` | iCloud Drive folder for synced config files |
| `git_scan_root` | `~/workspaces/` | Root directory for git repository discovery |
| `git_scan_max_depth` | `3` | Maximum depth for recursive `.git` directory search |
| `git_repos_manifest` | `git-repos.yaml` | Manifest file caching discovered repos |

---

## Architecture

```
synthesis-mac-sync (this skill)
  = the HOW — sync protocol, safety rules, conflict resolution, manifest format

Your config file (in your iCloud sync folder)
  = the WHAT — your specific file list, machine inventory, repo paths
```

The skill is invoked by the AI assistant. The assistant reads both this skill (for methodology) and your config file (for specifics), then executes the sync.

---

## Setup

### 1. Create a sync folder in iCloud

Create a folder in iCloud Drive to hold your synced configuration files. Example path:

```
~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/workspaces/[username]/mac-sync/
```

### 2. Create a config file (README.md)

Your config file lives in the sync folder. It contains:

- **Sync manifest** — which files to sync and where they map locally
- **Machine inventory** — your Mac hostnames and details
- **Git repo configuration** — optional repo sync settings
- **One-time actions** — machine-specific tasks to run once

See the **Config File Format** section below for the template.

### 3. Copy your config files into the sync folder

Mirror the directory structure. For example:
```
mac-sync/
  .gitconfig          → syncs to ~/.gitconfig
  .zshrc              → syncs to ~/.zshrc
  .config/app/keys.yaml → syncs to ~/.config/app/keys.yaml
```

---

## Sync Modes

### Full Sync ("run my mac-sync")

Performs all three operations:
1. **Config file sync** — bidirectional, based on modification timestamps
2. **Git repo sync** — fetch, pull if behind, push if ahead
3. **One-time actions** — execute any pending machine-specific actions

### Config-Only Sync

- **Pull from iCloud:** "sync my Mac config files from iCloud"
- **Push to iCloud:** "push my Mac config files to iCloud"

### Git-Only Sync

- **Full:** "sync my repos with GitHub"
- **Status only:** "show me the status of my repos"

---

## Performance — Minimize Tool Calls

**CRITICAL:** Mac-sync must run with minimal interactive tool calls. The user should NOT face dozens of approval prompts.

### Config file sync — ONE bash call

Write a single bash script that loops through ALL files in the manifest, compares them with `diff`, checks timestamps with `stat -f %m` if different, copies the newer version, and applies `chmod 600` to sensitive files. Execute this entire script in ONE `Bash` tool call. Do NOT run separate `diff`, `stat`, or `cp` commands for each file.

Example pattern:
```bash
ICLOUD_BASE="$HOME/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/workspaces/[username]/mac-sync"

sync_file() {
  local icloud="$1" local_path="$2" sensitive="$3"
  if [ ! -f "$icloud" ] && [ ! -f "$local_path" ]; then echo "SKIP (neither exists): $local_path"; return; fi
  if [ ! -f "$icloud" ]; then echo "COPY local→iCloud: $local_path"; cp "$local_path" "$icloud"; return; fi
  if [ ! -f "$local_path" ]; then echo "COPY iCloud→local: $local_path"; mkdir -p "$(dirname "$local_path")"; cp "$icloud" "$local_path"; [ "$sensitive" = "yes" ] && chmod 600 "$local_path"; return; fi
  if diff -q "$icloud" "$local_path" > /dev/null 2>&1; then echo "IDENTICAL: $local_path"; return; fi
  local icloud_ts=$(stat -f %m "$icloud") local_ts=$(stat -f %m "$local_path")
  if [ "$icloud_ts" -gt "$local_ts" ]; then echo "SYNC iCloud→local (newer): $local_path"; cp "$icloud" "$local_path"; [ "$sensitive" = "yes" ] && chmod 600 "$local_path"
  else echo "SYNC local→iCloud (newer): $local_path"; cp "$local_path" "$icloud"; fi
}

sync_file "$ICLOUD_BASE/.claude/CLAUDE.md" "$HOME/.claude/CLAUDE.md" "no"
# ... one line per manifest entry ...
```

### Git repo sync — TWO to THREE bash calls maximum

1. **Discovery + fetch all** (ONE call): `find` repos, then loop through all of them running `git fetch origin` in a single script.
2. **Status + auto-actions** (ONE call): Loop through all repos checking branch, ahead/behind, uncommitted changes, stashes. In the SAME script, automatically `git pull` repos that are behind and `git push` repos that are ahead with clean working trees. Collect all output into a structured summary.
3. **Follow-up actions** (ONE call, only if needed): Handle any repos that need individual attention (diverged, conflicts).

Example pattern for step 2:
```bash
REPOS=(
  "/path/to/repo1"
  "/path/to/repo2"
  # ...
)
for repo in "${REPOS[@]}"; do
  name=$(basename "$repo")
  branch=$(git -C "$repo" branch --show-current 2>/dev/null)
  if [ -z "$branch" ]; then echo "DETACHED: $name"; continue; fi
  counts=$(git -C "$repo" rev-list --left-right --count "origin/$branch...$branch" 2>/dev/null)
  behind=$(echo "$counts" | awk '{print $1}')
  ahead=$(echo "$counts" | awk '{print $2}')
  dirty=$(git -C "$repo" status --porcelain 2>/dev/null | head -5)
  if [ "$behind" -gt 0 ]; then git -C "$repo" pull origin "$branch" 2>&1 | sed "s/^/PULLED $name: /"; fi
  if [ "$ahead" -gt 0 ] && [ -z "$dirty" ]; then git -C "$repo" push origin "$branch" 2>&1 | sed "s/^/PUSHED $name: /"; fi
  [ -n "$dirty" ] && echo "DIRTY $name: $(echo "$dirty" | wc -l | tr -d ' ') files"
done
```

**Do NOT run individual tool calls per repo.** The whole point of mac-sync is automation without interaction.

## Config File Sync Protocol

### Bidirectional Sync (default)

For each file in the sync manifest (executed as a SINGLE batched script per the Performance section above):

1. Compare iCloud version with local version using `diff`
2. **If identical** → skip silently
3. **If different** → compare modification timestamps using `stat -f %m` (macOS)
4. **Copy the newer file over the older one** automatically
5. For sensitive files, ensure `chmod 600` after copying
6. Report what was synced in the summary

### Pull from iCloud

When user explicitly asks to pull:
1. Compare each iCloud file with its local counterpart
2. If different, copy iCloud → local automatically
3. Preserve permissions (chmod 600 for sensitive files)

### Push to iCloud

When user explicitly asks to push:
1. Compare each local file with its iCloud counterpart
2. If different, copy local → iCloud automatically

### Template File Expansion

For config files containing machine-specific paths, use template files with placeholders:
- **When pulling:** Replace `{{HOME}}` with `$HOME` and `{{USERNAME}}` with `$USER`
- **When pushing:** Replace current `$HOME` value with `{{HOME}}` and `$USER` value with `{{USERNAME}}`

### Safety Rules

1. **Automatic for one-sided changes** — if only one side changed, copy automatically
2. **Prompt only for conflicts** — if both sides changed and timestamps can't resolve, show diff and ask which to keep
3. **Preserve permissions** — sensitive files must be `chmod 600`
4. **Quote all paths** — iCloud paths contain spaces ("Mobile Documents")
5. **Never overwrite with empty** — if either file is empty or missing, do not overwrite the non-empty version
6. **Skip machine-specific path differences** — if the only differences are username-specific paths (e.g., `/Users/alice/` vs `/Users/bob/`), skip and note in summary

---

## Git Repository Sync Protocol

### Repository Discovery

Scan a configured directory (e.g., `~/workspaces/`) recursively:

```bash
find ~/workspaces -maxdepth 3 -name ".git" -type d 2>/dev/null
```

Maintain a **manifest file** (`git-repos.yaml`) that caches discovered repos, their categories, and their remote configurations for quick status checks and cross-machine remote sync. Refresh on each sync — this includes re-capturing all remotes per repo (see **Git Remote Sync Protocol**).

### Per-Repo Sync Procedure

**IMPORTANT:** All steps below must be executed as batched shell scripts, NOT individual tool calls per repo. See the **Performance — Minimize Tool Calls** section above.

**Step 1: Fetch all** — loop through every discovered repo and `git fetch origin` in a single script.

**Step 2: Status + auto-actions** — in a single script, loop through all repos:
- Get current branch, ahead/behind counts, uncommitted changes, stashes
- Pull if behind (automatic)
- Push if ahead and clean working tree (check push policy first — `pr-required` repos are reported, not pushed)
- If push fails (non-fast-forward), report but do not force push

**Step 3: Handle repos with uncommitted changes** — show the user what's uncommitted (file list per repo) and ask whether to commit and push each dirty repo. Present a suggested commit message for each. Do NOT silently skip — uncommitted changes are unsynced state.

### Safety Rules

1. **ALWAYS fetch first** — run `git fetch origin` before checking any status
2. **NEVER force push** — always use regular `git push`
3. **NEVER silently auto-commit** — always show uncommitted files and ask before committing. Uncommitted changes are unsynced state; ignoring them defeats the purpose of the sync. Group files into separate commits by topic — never bundle unrelated files
4. **NEVER bypass hooks without explicit permission** — if a pre-commit hook blocks a commit, STOP and ask the user. Never use `--no-verify` on your own. If the user approves bypassing for a specific commit, that approval does not extend to other commits
5. **Sanitize ALL commit messages** — never include people's names, company names, project codenames, article titles, or meeting topics in commit messages. Use generic descriptions like "Add meeting transcript", "Update context", "Add new blog post". Git history is persistent and can leak confidential information
6. **Push automatically if ahead** — if working tree is clean and repo is ahead, push without asking
7. **Pull automatically if behind** — pull new commits without asking
8. **Skip repos with no remote** — report them but don't fail
9. **Skip repos with conflicts** — report and let user resolve manually
10. **Skip repos mid-rebase/merge** — report the state, don't interfere
11. **One branch only** — only sync the current branch, don't switch branches
12. **Prompt only for diverged repos** — when both ahead and behind, ask for merge strategy

---

## Git Remote Sync Protocol

Remote configurations (name + URL pairs) are per-machine state stored in each repo's `.git/config`. Without explicit sync, a remote added on one Mac won't exist on the other.

### Capture (during scan/refresh)

When refreshing `git-repos.yaml`, capture all remotes per repo:

```bash
# For each discovered repo:
git -C "$repo_path" remote -v | grep '(fetch)' | awk '{print $1, $2}'
```

Write the results into the `remotes:` field of each repo entry in `git-repos.yaml`. This runs as part of the single batched scan script — not as separate tool calls.

### Reconcile (during pull/sync)

When syncing to a Mac, reconcile local remotes against the manifest:

```bash
# For each repo in git-repos.yaml, for each remote in the manifest:
existing_url=$(git -C "$repo_path" remote get-url "$remote_name" 2>/dev/null)
if [ -z "$existing_url" ]; then
  git -C "$repo_path" remote add "$remote_name" "$manifest_url"
  echo "ADDED $repo_name: $remote_name → $manifest_url"
elif [ "$existing_url" != "$manifest_url" ]; then
  git -C "$repo_path" remote set-url "$remote_name" "$manifest_url"
  echo "UPDATED $repo_name: $remote_name → $manifest_url (was: $existing_url)"
fi
```

Execute this as a SINGLE batched script across all repos — not individual tool calls.

### Safety Rules

1. **Never auto-remove remotes** — if a local remote exists but isn't in the manifest, flag it in the summary but do not delete. The manifest captures the last scan from one machine; the local remote may be intentionally machine-specific.
2. **Never overwrite origin with empty** — if the manifest has no `remotes:` field for a repo, skip reconciliation for that repo.
3. **Report all changes** — every add/update goes in the sync summary.
4. **Credentials in URLs are expected** — some remotes include usernames (e.g., `user@bitbucket.org`). These are not secrets (the password is in the credential helper, not the URL). Do not strip or redact them.

### Relationship to setup-git-remotes.sh

If you maintain a `setup-git-remotes.sh` bootstrap script, it serves as a fallback for initial machine setup (before repos are cloned and before the first mac-sync). Once `git-repos.yaml` captures remotes, the yaml is the authoritative source of truth. Keep the bootstrap script consistent with the yaml, or auto-generate it from the yaml during push.

---

## Automation Policy

Mac-sync is designed to run fully automated. The assistant should complete the entire sync without prompting, except in specific situations.

### Automated (never prompt)

- Config files identical → skip silently
- Config file changed on one side only → copy the changed version
- Git fetch → always do
- Git pull when behind → always do (fast-forward only)
- Git push when ahead, clean working tree → always do
- Clean repos → skip silently
- Repos with no remote → skip, note in summary
- Manifest update → always refresh
- One-time actions for a different machine → skip silently

### Must prompt (show details + ask for action)

1. **Repos with uncommitted changes** → show file list per repo, suggest commit message, ask whether to commit+push. Uncommitted local changes won't reach the other Mac — treating them as informational breaks the sync guarantee
2. **Config file conflict** — both sides changed, can't determine winner from timestamps
3. **Git repo diverged** — both ahead of AND behind remote
4. **Git merge conflict during pull** — automatic merge failed
5. **Repo in unexpected state** — mid-rebase, mid-merge, or detached HEAD
6. **Auth failure across multiple repos** — stop and alert
7. **Destructive action needed** — force push, hard reset, or branch deletion

### Report but take no action (never prompt)

- Repos with stashes → note in summary
- Non-fast-forward push failures → report, move on
- Repos with `push_policy: pr-required` → report unpushed commits

---

## Machine Inventory

Use `LocalHostName` as the unique machine identifier:

```bash
scutil --get LocalHostName
```

Why LocalHostName:
- Set explicitly per machine in System Settings → Sharing → Local hostname
- Won't accidentally collide (unlike usernames)
- Persists across OS updates
- Easy to check

### Machine Inventory Table Format

```markdown
| LocalHostName | Model | Username | Notes |
|---------------|-------|----------|-------|
| my-mac-mini | Mac mini M2 Pro | alice | Primary development |
| my-macbook | MacBook Pro M4 | alice | Secondary laptop |
```

---

## One-Time Actions

Machine-specific tasks that should run once per machine.

### Safety Protocol

1. **Detect current machine:** `scutil --get LocalHostName`
2. **Check eligibility:** Each action has a `Target:` field — `machine-name`, `ALL`, or `ALL EXCEPT machine-name`
3. **Execute or skip** based on match
4. **Update status** after execution: `machine-name [COMPLETED 2026-01-15]`
5. **Delete action** only when ALL targeted machines show `[COMPLETED]`

### Template

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD: Brief Description

**Target:** [LocalHostName(s) or ALL or ALL EXCEPT LocalHostName]
**Status:** [LocalHostName] [PENDING]

**Background:** Why this action is needed

**Action Required:**
\`\`\`bash
# Commands to run
\`\`\`

**Verification:** How to confirm it worked
```

---

## Summary Format

Present a summary after sync completes:

```
## Mac Sync Complete

### Actions Taken
- Pulled X repos (list with commit counts)
- Pushed X repos (list with commit counts)
- Synced X config files from iCloud/to iCloud

### Needs Attention (prompt user for these)
- Repos with uncommitted changes: [file list per repo + suggested commit message] — ask whether to commit+push
- Diverged repos: [list] — need merge strategy decision
- Merge conflicts: [list] — need manual resolution
- Repos in unexpected state: [list] — mid-rebase/merge/detached HEAD

### Informational (no action needed)
- Repos with stashes: [list]
- Push failures (non-fast-forward): [list]
- Repos with no remote: [list]
- Clean repos: X repos
```

Only prompt for items in "Needs Attention." Everything else is informational.

---

## Config File Format

Your config file (README.md in the sync folder) should include these sections. Adapt to your needs:

### Sync Manifest — Direct Copy Files

```markdown
| iCloud Path (relative) | Local Path | Purpose | Sensitive? |
|------------------------|------------|---------|------------|
| `.gitconfig` | `~/.gitconfig` | Git identity | No |
| `.zshrc` | `~/.zshrc` | Shell config | No |
| `.config/app/keys.yaml` | `~/.config/app/keys.yaml` | API keys | **Yes** |
```

### Sync Manifest — Template Files

```markdown
| iCloud Path (relative) | Local Path | Placeholders | Sensitive? |
|------------------------|------------|-------------|------------|
| `.ssh/config.template` | `~/.ssh/config` | `{{HOME}}`, `{{USERNAME}}` | No |
```

### Git Repository Manifest (git-repos.yaml)

```yaml
scan_root: ~/workspaces
max_depth: 3
total_repos: 12

repositories:
  - path: ~/workspaces/personal/my-app
    category: personal
    remotes:
      origin: https://github.com/user/my-app.git

  - path: ~/workspaces/work/app
    category: work
    push_policy: pr-required
    remotes:
      origin: https://github.com/org/app.git
      mirror: https://github.com/other-org/app.git

excluded:
  # - ~/workspaces/personal/some-fork  # Reason: upstream only
```

The `remotes` field captures all configured git remotes per repo. This is the source of truth for remote topology across machines — when mac-sync runs on a second Mac, it reconciles local remotes against this manifest. See **Git Remote Sync Protocol** below.

### Machine Inventory

Document your machines with the table format above.

### One-Time Actions

Use the template above for machine-specific tasks.

---

## Adding New Files to Sync

### Direct copy file
1. Copy it to the sync folder (maintaining directory structure)
2. Add it to the sync manifest table
3. Note if it contains secrets (for permissions)

### Template file (contains machine-specific paths)
1. Create a `.template` version with `{{HOME}}` and `{{USERNAME}}` placeholders
2. Add it to the template files table
3. Document which placeholders are used
